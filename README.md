# U.S. City Sunshine Analysis
For project 2 our group did an analysis of the amount of sunshine different cities receive on average and at different points throughout the year. We were getting tired of the cold Midwest weather and wanted to determine the best places to travel to get the most amount of sun. We set out to create an interactive dashboard displaying a map of the U.S. with markers over the cities we analyzed. When you select a marker and hit the “generate report” button, a dial will populate with the average sunshine score over the course of a year for that city. A line chart will also populate upon selecting the “generate report” button that shows that city’s sunshine score each month over the course of a year. 

We leveraged two different datasets—one dataset containing a list of U.S. cities with their latitude and longitude, and one containing the sunshine scores for U.S. cities over the course of a year. We merged those two datasets and used MapBox to populate our visuals. Additionally, we leveraged a new JS library we had not seen in class called “knob” to populate our dial visuals.
